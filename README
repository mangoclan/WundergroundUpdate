WundergroundUpdate updates the Weather Underground site (wunderground.com)
with data from the Oregon Scientific WMR200A personal weather station.

It will probably work with other Oregon Scientific weather stations, and
perhaps with slight modification for any weather station supported by
Weather Display.
 
This code was developed for Weather Display version 10.37j build 01. When
executed, this program reads the last line of Weather Display's log file,
parses the values into a hashmap using wunderground.com's URL parameters as
keys. It then updates the data to wunderground.com via an HTTP request.
 
In order to use this program you must first create an account and a station
ID and password at wunderground.com. The station ID and password must then
be configured in WundergruondUpdate.properties, along with the Weather Display
log location if you did not install Weather Display in the default location
(c:/wdisplay).
 
The properties file is distributed as WundergroundUpdate.properties.txt.
Copy this file to WundergroundUpdate.properties and edit the new file to
add your wunderground.com credentials and Weather Update log path.

Compile the application into a jar file. The WundergroundUpdate.jardesc
file can be used if you are using Eclipse. Otherwise just make sure the
jar file contains:
- com/mangoclan/WundergroundUpdate.class
- com/mangoclan/WundergroundUpdate.properties
- a manifest that specifies the Main-Class

The application must be run on a schedule as it only performs a single update
each time it is executed.  On Windows, use Task Scheduler and schedule
the application to trigger at system startup and repeat at a frequency of
your choice (suggestion: 5 minutes).

The command to execute the application is:

javaw -jar WundergroundUpdate.jar
